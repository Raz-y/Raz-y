# Hi, I'm Raz! üëã

## About Me

üéì I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the Open University of Israel, trying to leverage technology to solve problems. With a background as a Tier 2 Help Desk and Tier 1 Applicative Support, I excel in problem-solving, customer service, and collaboration.

üë®‚Äçüíª My current focus is on mastering Backend Development and DevOps, or as I like to call it, "BackOps"‚Äîbecause we love using acronyms for everything. I thrive in dynamic, technology-filled environments.

## Current Projects and Learning Focus
- [Documenting my journey](https://medium.com/@raz.devit) into **Backend Development** with a focus on **Golang**, inspired by the [Backend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend).
- Exploring DevOps practices to integrate them with backend development.
- Continuing my Computer Science degree with an emphasis on practical, hands-on projects to solidify my understanding of complex systems.

## Blogging
- I write about the things I learned covering topics like backend development, DevOps, and how to leverage tech -	[![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-black?logo=medium&logoColor=white)](https://medium.com/@raz.devit)
- To combine what I like and what I learn I write about the intersection of technology and fitness on my blog [![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-black?logo=medium&logoColor=white)](https://medium.com/@fitwtech)

## I'm Seeking
- Opportunities to apply my backend and DevOps skills in impactful projects.
- Mentorship and guidance in advancing my career in Backend Development and DevOps.
- Collaborations with like-minded professionals who are passionate about tech and innovation.
